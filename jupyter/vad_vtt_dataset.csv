vi4flB6clm0iow6IFTbC7emI,8,07:24.650,10:16.980,Kanishka Rao,"Okay. Okay. The thing on my mind is, essentially, I came up with a framework of what's wrong with our solution from a sales perspective, from a health system sales perspective, our solution goes wrong in one of three places. First stage gate is a clinician isn't excited about the problem we're solving. Like, we're being a small problem in the scheme of things. And this is like, for certain clinicians, right, for the CMO, like, asthma is too small a problem. You know, head of pop health, asthma is too small a problem. Even for the chief of pulmonology, asthma may be too small a problem, but for the director of asthma, you know, we figure this out. But then you get to step two, which is okay, if a clinician likes this, thinks it's important, wants to champion it, can we get an executive to say, and this is worth doing, you know, putting resources behind to some extent in the near term. And I think, like, as my large health systems really falls off the radar, just in terms of, like, there's not that much money there. There's not that much reason to improve unless we find something new. The flip being that the. Space where this has worked is the, is the children's asthma space of pediatric health systems. Because now you're talking about the second biggest disease, if not the biggest, in pediatrics. Yeah. Like, the diabetes and asthma are just like, everything for kids. Same way, like heart diseases for cancer for adults. Um, then last question is, even if we can convince someone, the clinician says it's good to do, the executives say it's a high priority. Can we get it to say we need these guys to do it versus we should do it ourselves? That's where things like incidental lung nodules fell apart because we convinced the clinician it was good. We clinician, we convinced the executives that it was worth doing. And then when we got to it, they said, well, we'll just build this. Yeah. And even though it's going to be slower and, you know, time consuming for them, they're just like, we can do this ourselves. We don't need to bring in another vendor for it. And so, like, basically all our sales motions have gone wrong in one of these areas.",172.33000000000004,395,1,18,0,1,26,0.18871212121212125,-0.13209090909090906,0.04369696969696972,24.910000000000004,-17.435999999999996,5.768000000000003,132,137.52683804328902

So I just want to get a sense of where health systems are with hospital readmission penalties and also with MIps. Now they are actually on different things. So HRP is on a health systems fee for service revenue, Medicare fee for service revenue. Sorry. And MiPs is on a health systems, Medicare value based revenue. So the piece that's not fee for service. Right. So if you could, if we could find out specific and, and then for Archner and for. But generally figure out how we can do this. Oh, merit incentive payment system. I'll send you my notes on it, actually. So I will, I'll actually, let me share this with you. Yeah, I thought he is. So I just want to see if he's joining me, that he comes. Okay. Hey, so what I asked Brian to do, and maybe Scott, leave it, because you've done stuff on this. So he's not repeating stuff enough. So I want to look at two things, and this is heart failure. Right. So one is I want to look at how a hospital is doing with HRP, and HRP is up to 3% of a hospital's. Correct me if I'm wrong, fee for service, Medicare revenue. Correct, Scott? Scott, is that right? And MiPs is up to 9% plus or minus on a hospital's value based care revenue. It's a merit based. Merit based in incentive bonus payment, something like payment system. Right. And I've done some analysis on both and I'll send it to you, but what I'd like to do is there's a methodology for do we just need to figure out, I don't know what Scott, what Scott has done already for those two things. I know he put something to readmission. So if you can share that with you, that would be great. That information is publicly available. So 23 information should be available by now on the same. And I sent you the link in the email. I mean, not the link sent to where it's supposed to be available. So if you could do a bit of research. And the reason this brings up is on Thursday, I'm talking to Austria, on Friday, we're talking to Mount Sinai. So start with the reimbursement penalties. Did either of them have reimbursement penalties? And I'll actually let Scott describe to you the file he has. I sent that to him. I didn't understand it. So if you want to share the file, Scott, and talk, I'll walk us through it. That'd be great. And Brian, if you want to repurpose today's hour to time to actually go do it, that's fine. I can share the information I have done with you sort of on the overall structure so you can understand that, Scott, if you want to join. I mean, I've done a fair bit of research on MIPs and HRP. I can share that with you at about 530 if you want it to join. If you're not, I'll just talk to Brian about it. So. But why don't you share the information you've already done? I know you've looked at it to some extent. I have no idea what the file means. So as of 2022, it. Yeah, I said there's some other places you could look at, too. I mean, 2022. Right. But they could have reacted and really fixed it. So if you have 23, that's great. But I sent you. Yeah. Oh, you got it for 2016. I can't imagine that is any particularly bad. But it's supposed to be publicly available. I don't know where exactly. It, no, it doesn't, it's so out of date and it doesn't really help. And I don't know. I don't think it, I mean, I send you more links. Just go look at those other links. First of all, I mean, not links. I sent you more information. So just go look at that and see if it's, if it's helpful. That's all. I'm interested in knowing how many millions of dollars they paid. That's really what I want to know. I want to know. Percentage it calculated to do. I want to know what their fee for service. Now, if you know their total revenue, you can probably estimate their fee for service because it's about, Medicare is about 64 to 50% to 60%. And usually fee for service versus value is 60 40. So, you know, those are the things sort of. You could do that, but it's not, it's not super accurate, but it's better than nothing. Okay. I got to go. Doctor J. Michael and Feynman. So I just want to get you two guys together. But I sent you some information if you need me to find those links to, because the links were lost when I copied them. It's in the email, but you should be able to look it up. All right. All right. Okay. Okay. Thanks. It. It. Oh, she sent it. Hey, Maureen, I just realized you sent it. So I didn't have a chance to look at it, but great. It. So this is. I understand the team, but this is not the agreement. This is not the agreement we had with Cash, our executive sponsor, regarding how to. Was cash involved in this discussion? I mean, I just want to be very transparent because this is. Cash has this notion of a sandbox where we come in and innovate. Hackensack benefits and we benefit. Right. That is the agreement which is put together. That is his vision. That is explicitly not. This is explicitly the exact opposite of what he agreed to. So I just want to know if Cash has been consulted on this because when I spoke to him again and verified, he vehemently agreed. This was the vision. So is it worth getting on the phone with Cash? And who's everybody? I just want to know, was cash involved in that? So Sameer would like to revisit Sameer would like to revisit this. So if Sameer agrees that the thing is okay, then there's no issue. So Sameer is the. The concern is with regards to Sameer's opinion as a business lead. So I just want to make sure where the push is. Everyone is awake. It's the DT's team, but it's within DT's. It. Maureen, my concern, and I want to be clear, and maybe this is just worth having a call with gash and Sameer, my concern, I'm fine with anything that involves data. Absolutely. I just don't want anything that's software that has nothing to do with data. Zero to do with data, to say, oh, we build an interface. Just an interface, just a straight interface. It's got nothing to do with data. Or we build, you know, something to extract some, some information that somehow becomes joint IP. That is my concern. I totally, I mean, 1000% agreement regarding anything to do with Phi. I mean, agreement, and we can carve that out, but we can't have a situation where our. So let's say we have software, right? And then doctor Fine says, hey, I'd like you to move the button from the left to the right. Just giving you an example. We move it and now suddenly it becomes joint IP because doctor Fine said, move the button from the left to the right. So the other option, which is not going to please cash, is that we say we make zero changes to software. If Hackensack has any request, we go through. Clear. We go through a long process which says, you have to agree that this doesn't include on our IP. You understand my viewpoint, that I can't afford a situation where someone says, you built some software, and now, because somebody gave some minor suggestion to it that that IP is now joined. That is my only concern. My concern is not with anything to do with data. I totally get anything with data. Zero issues. What about if someone gives suggestions? Yeah, right. So therefore, since we can't afford to have our software polluted even one bit, I mean, just this, I can't be in a situation. Let me clear that. When I go to someone else and Hackensack says, no, you can't. Oh, this is Jon Diap. Or we go to some health system and they say, hey, this is. I'll have to talk to cash about it. Because we have to be able to carve out software from this. I understand your concern about HIPAA, and I totally get it. And I'm not saying anything. You're referring to Hackensack's policies. I agree completely. But you understand my dilemma, right? It totally get and I totally can't. Yeah, go ahead. Non AI, non data. Nothing to do with hack and sack portion. We so non AI, non phi and non data. The alternative said, yeah, go ahead. Yeah. And that is just, that is a right. That they could be a situation where they say, no, this is joint. I mean, though the intention is not. And that is a problem if. Yeah, but Maureen, Maureen, here's my question. Someone says move the button from the left to the right. By the legal definition of joint IP, they contributed to moving a button that was on the left of the screen, to the right of the screen. That is now joint IP, because we took an idea from someone hacking to move a button. By the technical definition, Marine, you know, that's, now we've made a change in our software because of input we got. Right. That's all. Go ahead. Okay. So. It.

So just one quick thing I wanted to go through today before we could go do the broader thing on Monday, is what I've got down is what we're prioritizing this month and our priorities and what. So basically in order, I think, I guess this is technically September, what we talked about, right? Like, we've got this one big hairy thing, right? Which is we are contractually obligated to send two health systems this year. And Jefferson's moving, but gotta stay on top of that. And then there's trying to push some of these other things, like transplant, which Sri and Scott are taking, and this heart failure sail Bart's taking for these other health systems where we have a c level contact who could push something through. So basically, like, that's gotta be priority one for everything we're doing. And we should make sure that we minimize any other work delaying that or impacting that. Second, I think, is, hey, Carl, I'm just going through basically this priority list, and I wanted to get everyone's feedback, and we can dive into greater detail on. Monday. First is we need to sell a health system at Jefferson. Second is we're spending all this money on all these conferences in October. Let's be ready to capitalize on them both in terms of being ready to sell people who are ready for that. And that's one part. And the second is working on this broader strategy of how do we find the silver bullet for idns to sell this broader solution in pulmonology. And this is all for with a focus on Sua, right? Like if we are to scale our SUa offering, you know, if AZ is going to be our gravy train on Sua for at least till series a, you know, we need to figure out how we're selling Sua into health systems, and that's the priority. Number two. Third thing is getting that money for Sua from AZ, you know, and like building that solution effectively. And so I think this is where, you know, measuring the data. What we talking about, Bill, this morning? Improving the GDMT solution, which I think we can get in greater detail on this. But just like, what are those levers tree we were talking about this morning? And let's not wait until we do all the analysis to start talking about improving the solution from a GDMT perspective. Let's like start those conversations now. Let's figure out how we can get those conversations going between you and birth there, how much and how we pull in Alex and things like that to understand everything that's going on and whatnot, and then nailing down our compliant contracting. We heard the importance of that yesterday from Dave on the AC side. I think these three things should be our priorities. I think they should be in this order in terms of where we make trade offs. And I think what's clear is this last bucket is like, how do we get. Revenue is a fourth priority to all of these things for this month. And that's, you know, burning calories on how do we sell heart failure to AZ at Jefferson? You know, that's how do we go after COPD or Sbir or Genentech? Phase two, like these should all be a secondary thing from a leadership perspective. Let me pause for a second there.",287.095,586,0,21,0,7,39,0.27888324873096465,-0.19227411167512687,0.06243654822335026,54.94000000000003,-37.87799999999999,12.300000000000002,197,122.46817255612254

We have to do that because of the contract. We have to get two by 2020. Prep for conferences. We have four conferences coming up. Five conferences. However you want to count them on number three. My question is three a and three c make sense to me because there is a October 1 deadline, three b. There's nothing that can be done between now and October 1. So it is a, it is a important thing. I'm just going. And maybe this is right. I'm going to question whether, for example, Barrett's time. You're saying focusing on GDMT improvement, which isn't going to happen by October 1, is more important than SBIR. Is that what you're saying is time? Because SBIR also has a time element associated with it, whereas it's tough because improving GDMT is something we have to do. But if you say between now and October, September 30, if we do it, is it going to help us or if we can wait till October 1 and do it? Like what? I'm just questioning.

It's, if you're telling people this is what you need to focus on, 1st, 2nd, third, to me it does. If you don't meet a enough information to convince AZ by October 1 to carve out next year, the rest of it's irrelevant. Right. You've laid this out in order of priority. I'm fine with it. I'm going to question Sbir next, but I'm fine with. 1234. I'm not, I'm not saying get rid of it, but there's in no world do I believe that number four is at the same level as three A and three B.

We're committing massive money and time and conferences. So two is clearly critical. One, it's clearly critical because we sign a damn contract and we better execute on it.

One reason is we need money. We want the dollars are important. The dollars in and of themselves are important. The other reason is that it's a validation of. Of our business model as a validation that we have, it's been able to demonstrate value. It's sort of a validation that what we're doing is working. Right.

Is there, will there be money next year if they don't give us a budget line item? Yes, we can use, there's always slush funding and we can get a few hundred thousand bucks here and there like we, like we do always. Right. But if we're willing to say, you know what we're going to spend, we're going to take another couple hundred thousand bucks maybe for something, and then in 26 we're going to really try to push this thing, then the question is, is that we are now spending another year focusing on pulmonology. So then it becomes a strategic question, actually. So from a validation perspective, it's important, right. Is a, does AZ value pulmonology to the extent and pulmonology with diarrhea to the point that they're willing to nothing sign a contract, but willing to say we'll budget some money and see what happens. And if they're not willing to do that, then we have to ask ourselves, why is pulmonology important for us? Right. We still have to do, hmh.

Right. Like, I know that you are having some transparency issues with, uh, sage. So what do we all need? That's one thing that I would like to set up so that it's easier for you all as well. And, uh, I think the second thing would be, uh, this access thing with, uh, Jason so that he gets what he needs ASAP, because I think he also has to start working on his clients right now. So that would be another thing to, like, uh, discuss and close and, uh, yeah, I think that's pretty much the main. Oh, and the other thing is we should, like, really, really start charging for, like, cleanup because, like, accounting and I will also, like, going through, like, historical data. And we notice, like, a lot of these clients are, like, let's say they turn in, like, three, four months, and we've done, like, one, two years of catch up. It's. It's actually too expensive. The only reason, I think the only reason we are on, like, a loss making side, like, at least sage, is only because of the onboarding part. So if we just start charging for that, that will be helpful. And the last thing that's coming with the onboarding thing is that I feel everyone, even though you tell them that it'll take 30 days to onboard. So there are some clients that can be onboarded in 15 days, some in 30, some probably take longer. So every client that we say that onboarding is 30 days. If they want it faster, let's charge an expedited fee. Not because we want the fee or anything. It's just because everyone wants it expedited. So just to avoid everyone asking us to rush, it will make sense to charge an expedited fee. So these were, like, just a couple of things that I wanted to go over.

Like, I'm just one little person, but, um, I think that there's two strategies that would work really well in this role, and one would be hiring my doppelganger and having that person run the accounting teams, run cs, like, handle all of that and tap you in with our top tier clients for upselling and consulting and all of that. But be really mindful of your time. I think the other strategic option is hiring somebody lower caliber, almost like Saroon, who I met with, that was Evans referral. She would be so phenomenal in a client facing role that's pretty transactional and wouldn't need to strategize and be looking at revenue and subscriptions and process and managing that accounting team.

I'm in all of. Awe of you all the time with the value that you drive with our clients, and I think that's so important. But you being involved in the day to day and the. Oh, and being. Having any hand and, like, sage and all of that, I get the sense that, like, you want to focus on bigger strategic things, but are still, like, pulled into the day to day minutiae and had somebody in the role that you could communicate a transition plan to free up and optimize your schedule for those bigger picture things. I could be totally wrong. I think that's just the sense that I got. And I think depending on what you want to do and what you want your day to day to look like, what you want, like, your quarters to be driven by, should inform the next person that goes into this role, because I think that your value is not like answering WhatsApp questions from Uth Karsh and dealing with the inbox, like, get the fuck out of the inbox. You are the. You're the founder of the company. You need to focus on the podcast, the brand, the top tier clients, those sort of things that if that's what drives you, I don't. I honestly, I wanted to have this conversation with you in New York, and I feel like that opportunity was missed a little bit.

I have suggestions, but does that work for you? And how can I free up your time to do the things that you want to focus on? And I know you maybe haven't had, like, maybe Christina wasn't that person that could have empowered you in that way. So you weren't even thinking of that level of transition, of, like, what's next? I don't know, but that's kind of the sense that I got and what I would have loved is for us to have had that conversation sooner so I could have been more effective for you and then also really, like, maybe.

With you in the role, like, the transition was happening. I just am a terrible communicator, which isn't great for someone who's dealing with terrible communicators.

Like, not like I need to go back in to it all. I go back to 100% in on this stuff until we figure it all out. And I want to be respectful of, like, your time.

And I already told the other founder, he's, like, a friend of mine that I know through, you know, for a long time through the accelerator and other things, but I told him how important it was to me that I have this option, at least, because I'm not somebody that gets started with a company and then just quits.

Oftentimes, people are very busy on the wrong things, but it's hard to distinguish between what the right and the wrong things are when you're not in the right mind space, as this work is really all about helping you clarify your vision so you can see things as important or not important for yourself. And so I would say that we haven't had a client come through who hasn't said that their decision making did not get significantly better as a result of the coaching they did.

Emily and I are super similar and it was super great talking to her. And like the combination of the founder. And psychology is, like, pretty unicorn for her. With that said, she talked about the, like, she comes at it from more of a therapy mindset, and it's like a 50 minutes call and she doesn't do any support between sessions. So one thing actually, like, with my personal therapist, like, I love my personal therapist, but we're pretty strict about 50 minutes. And especially when I was working through a lot with her, I have other friends, and I know this isn't, like, a requirement of therapists, but I have other friends who have therapists will schedule 60 minutes calls, and if they need to go over by ten or 15 minutes, they do. There is just something about that kind of partnership that feels less transactional and more like partnership, that in the case of my personal therapist, I love her enough. And my example is I'll text her and be like, oh, my God, I'm freaking out about this thing. I'm super pissed at my roommate, whatever. And she'll respond and be like, I totally get it. Like, I know you, an ex person, have been, like, having issues, but just, like, try to take a step back and take some deep breath. But it's not like, let's solve the problem right now. It's like, I'm going to kind of chill you out for a second, and then I'll remember to ask you about this on our next session. Versus, like, with Lauren speaking with Rosa, she's like, I text Laurenous on a Tuesday at 08:00 a.m. and she answers me. And so just like, in terms of my kind of framework of a coach, the Lauren method is a lot more of what I would want. And I said that to Emily up front. I was like. She was like, why are you interested in coaching? And I was kind of like, well, a lot of it has to do with this more, like, on demand access. And she was like, well, I don't do that. And I was like, okay, so that's more of even, like, a data point, I guess, for you on, like, the different types of people. Like, that is something, at least for me. And also, I know, like, for Alice, like, having someone, and it's something Rosa mentioned, having someone there as live as possible is insanely important. So, like, in that case, I find Emily to be, like, a little bit disqualified because the nature of, like, every. Every week we have 50 minutes a week is just, like, a little bit too limited for the kind of support that I think I would want. With that being said, she is amazing, and I would want to work with her if she had more of the constant stuff.

One, I feel like I've turned some corner in the last couple of weeks of, like, actually having stepped into my manager role and my leadership. And frankly, I think a lot of that was even, like, talking to you about the discovery process helped me think through a lot of stuff in a good way. I feel like I've made a lot of progress.

Everything for MVP can be done inside of, like, all the data stays inside of Google Drive except for this one thing, which is the trimming of the start and end time of the actual video, which is basically what allows us to actually have the clips. Marco looked around. I also looked around. Basically, the only scrappy way to do this is to take the video, send it to an API, and then have it send us back the clips. So it's not. And, like, from looking at it, basically, it's like, we would need to do. My opinion, it's like, we would need to do a lot more work here before we just touched, like, real client data for right now. My instinct is, like, this is good enough for us to do Alpha, but basically that's what I wanted to think through is basically, do we, like, green light Marco, to make this with this API, take the easy route, knowing that we are going to need to do.

There is a way we can do it, which is basically, we get encryption set up. So it's. We do our due diligence on the actual API that it's getting sent to and from. We make sure things are encrypted when we send them. You have an end to end encryption of the actual videos. You make sure that their data policies, they're not, like, storing all the videos themselves. Like, there's a bunch of stuff that we would. This solution can work.

vi5R4N92m3GJC6XbBpmbrDAs,10,01:51.894,06:27.870,AJ Goldstein,"Sure. Yeah. So I would say overall I'm quite good. I am pretty intentional and obsessive about improving my health in different ways throughout my life. Worked with a lot of different people to help me with that over the years. Let's see, we can break it up in a lot of different dimensions. I mean, sleep, I think, is a thing that I have relatively in control. It's just a matter of me getting to bed at a reasonable time, which I'm not usually the best at, is just because of work stuff and pulling me in to keep me up longer later than I would expect. When I'm disciplined about that and I get up at a decent hour, then I'm usually pretty good. Pretty good shape. Working out wise, I definitely realized I don't have as much muscle mass as I want to have these days. Since I started working with a personal trainer recently, that's been an improvement. I think I needed a lot of education around. I have a whole library of exercises I know I like, but, um, there's a, there's, I think, a lack of, like, variety in what I've been doing day to day and week to week. And so I want to get more, more new workouts in trying to improve my, my strength, and so been working with trainer for that. My form also isn't the best. Always trying to improve that to reduce injury and improve, just, like, effectiveness of lifting, especially moving on to diet. I mean, I have this. Sorry. I basically ordered cookie, uni and pure plate, which I eat every week all throughout the day. And most of my meals now these days come from cooking uni and pure plate, unless I'm eating out, usually with people, which I don't. Which I don't know the exact split, but it's not very often as much as probably 20% of the time, as opposed to 80% of the time I'm eating meals that have been pre made with my girlfriend or my teammates, et cetera. Let's see areas of need that I know I want to improve on. I think we talked about snacking last time is probably a big area that I. I want to be eating more consistently throughout the day. I think I'm kind of getting bored of peer planning. Cooking uni to some extent. Like, I feel like it's the same meals and I. And I need a little bit more variety in order to be happy. And so the problem is, is that getting kind of right into the meat of it. Like, I don't have time and I'm not going to make time for it. And so I think, like, that's just being completely realistic about it. Like, I'm never going to have time to cook a home cooked meal. That's, like, never going to happen, ever. At least not these days. And so I'm pretty close minded about that idea. I think, though, that things are easy for me. Include when food's being delivered and I can actually just put in the microwave. That's why I like pure plating. Cooking uni so much makes it very easy for me. I think I also don't really have time to go to the grocery store, and so I would say getting food from, like, who it's delivered is probably reasonable and possible as well. Like, in terms of, like, if I were to have instacart or door or doordash, but the act of actually going on and trying to, like, order food from a grocery store is so time consuming and overwhelming. Sorry about that. That I just don't have. I just don't have the mental capacity to do that, let alone, like, going on for 15 minutes every week and ordering which cook uni meals I'm going to get for the following week already doesn't happen, like, one out of four times. I just don't have. I don't make the space for that. And so I think it just needs to be easier. Like, the ideal. The dream scenario would be that I have that on completely on autopilot, where someone knows what I like and what I want to eat and what I generally my preferences as well as like, what kind of macronutrients I need to fulfill. And it's just like automatically. And maybe I get the confirmation to see if I can make any suggestions or edits on those orders that are being placed each week. But going on and picking out two bananas, five greek yogurts, six blueberry orders, I just am not going to make time for that realistically. So I think it's. I think that's the challenge is like, any busy person, it's like, I want to eat well, but I want to do it without effort. And I also want to have enough variety, which right now I think I've kind of optimized for the speed piece, but I'm getting bored of what I'm eating week to week. So I guess that's the main area we could explore here.",275.976,852,1,51,0,0,57,0.33285813148788934,-0.19340484429065724,0.05944636678200693,96.19600000000003,-55.89399999999994,17.180000000000003,289,185.23349856509262

I think I've tried googling at least a dozen times, like, healthy fast breakfast. And I fucking hated all the ideas that I got from online websites and blogs.

And then those get placed and ordered and they just show up, and then I can put them in the fridge when they get here, and then, boom, they're just waiting for me each week.

Yeah, I think, I mean, I can give you a lot of ideas right now, but in your case, you're looking to optimize your health. So we need to be way more specific. And for that I recommend doing the lab test so we can understand what your body really needs and what fits best for your own needs. And in that way we can optimize your health. So after I discover what are the best foods that you should have or avoid, then I can create a specific meal plan for you that will look like what are the best options for breakfast, for lunch, for dinner. When you are like placing the order at like the pre made meals, we know exactly what to eat or what not to eat. What snacks are the best for you so you can have them on hand? There are many options that are easy for breakfast. Like could be just a good smoothie in the morning, a protein shake with a fruit. But we need to know, like what are you reacting to or not? You mentioned that one of your goals is to build muscle. You are working with a trainer for that. And we need to be very intentional around nutrition because working out is probably 30% 20% of your results. And what's going to really support that? It's nutrition. And not only that, but how your digestive system is working for you. Meaning that if you're having enough protein per day, but if your digestive system is not breaking that down for you, then your muscles are not going to get the building blocks, the amino acids that they need to build up the muscle. Two things that I recommend for you. One, understanding how's your digestive system working for you. We will talk about how that affects your energy levels, method, clarity, digestion, of course, and then what foods are the best for you. In that way, we can optimize energy levels and bring down inflammation levels as well.",110.67999999999995,344,0,11,0,3,23,0.34587387387387375,-0.17601801801801795,0.08380180180180183,38.39199999999999,-19.537999999999993,9.302000000000003,111,186.48355619804852

I've tried over 200 different morning routines over the last eight and a half years. I've worked with, like, 50 different coaches and therapists during that time. Like, I'm as obsessed about health optimization as it gets. I. I think it's less of like a. Yeah, I don't know. I guess, like, I don't feel like I have. This is probably going to be a lot of clients, right? Coming out of tight and saying, I don't feel like I have a problem in this department per se, but I think there's always opportunities for improvement. I think the real question, the conversation I think we should be having here is, how do we do this in a way that's like, as easy and simple as humanly possible. So I have some ideas if you want to hear them, but I don't know if you have any other questions. Okay. Literally, I'll show you right now. This is probably the best eight minutes of this call. So I'm going to show you. This is how I order every week. There's two things I do. I go on this website and I place. This is like cook uni. And I basically go on and I choose what meals I want each week, right? And so I do that by browsing the menu. My restrictions are that I only eat. I eat vegetarian, vegan. I eat, let's see, where's it, sorry, not diets. I want that. I eat vegan, vegetarian fish. Basically, I'm pescetarian, so I eat everything. I eat fish, but I don't eat meat. I just narrow it on that. I have 140 meals available now. I have about twelve meals I order each week from cook unity. So the question becomes is which of these meals am I going to add to the cart? Right? I scroll through them all, and I will choose from all these different options. There's over. There's 140 of them which ones I'm going to order, right? And what I've been doing recently, and I'll show you literally the ones I ordered. This is like a typical order for me, right? I've ordered all these things before, and I know that I like them, so I'm just ordering them again. A handful of meals are breakfast meals because I have an solving breakfast by just doing it through cooking uni. So I'll have like, a mission style breakfast egg burrito. Um, I'll have caramelized mushroom quesadilla. I'll have, uh, this, like, corn, uh, arepa with veggies and egg and queso. Those are my kind of breakfast meals. I don't like the cheese component of it. If I were to eliminate something in my diet, it would be, I think, like, I have a hard time not eating cheese and dairy, but I know I don't feel really great. I usually feel more congested when I eat cheese. It's kind of hard to find enough good meals that don't have cheese. And so you'll see all the other ones besides the breakfast don't really have cheese because I try to eliminate as much as I can, minimize that. This is my next week. A lot of the similar meals you see, once again, it's like, I'd say four out of five of these are the same, right? And there's a few new ones. I added an impossible cheeseburger, a salmon burger, rainbow grain salad with grilled salmon, and this grilled spicy salmon that I didn't have last time. But otherwise, there's a lot of overlap, right? Same curry with tofu, same quinoa and caramelized onion. What is this? Mujadhara. Same bunch of other same stuff. So I think it's the lack of variety. And I'll show you also on another thing is, I do pure plate. Here's what that looks like. Every week I get a new menu. And this is what the menu looks like. It's like, basically they're going to offer chicken and beef and seafood and vegetarian. And I basically place an order, actually looks like this is a good example. They're like, here's the meals for this week. And I say, I want one. Whoa, sorry. I want two chicken with tofu as protein, two beef with tofu as protein, two fish meals, and then one vegetarian. Right. So I can swap out. I don't eat chicken or steak, but they. Or beef. But they give me the option of putting in tofu as placed in the protein. And I like a lot of these veggies. So the ideal for me is, like, combination of plant based protein. And seafood protein, like a lot of vegetables added in as well. And so this is basically what I've been doing for the last, like, few months here is I have about seven to ten meals from pure plate each week. And then I have between twelve to 16 meals from cooking unity each week. And I'm ordering them and I'm eating them and it's good. It's delicious. I feel like I'm satisfying my needs. The problem is I don't have snacks. My office is empty of food, so I'm hungry throughout my meals. And I don't really. I don't quite feel ready to eat like a 600 calorie meal. I want like a 200 to 300 calorie, kind of like maybe middle ground of sorts. And then also I get bored of this shit. And then also, like, there's a problem of cheese. Like, I don't know what to do about the cheese because I don't think there's enough. It's America and we fucking love cheese. And so how do I solve for that? So is that helpful context?",319.30600000000004,961,3,58,1,11,98,0.2975953079178888,-0.22309090909090895,-0.02690322580645164,101.48000000000008,-76.07399999999996,-9.17400000000001,341,180.57913099033527

Like, I don't know if any thoughts on. I'm happy to kind of, like, I think this is where, like, the concierge, we can get really creative about the concierge aspect of it. Like, if you can go in and literally, I'll give you my login for cook unity, or you can look at the weekly meals for me, your plate, or have someone on your team do it right and be able to just, like, help me pick and select why. Like, these are the areas I'm lacking in my current sensitivity tests. Here's how this maps to decisions I can make about which meals to order in cooking. Unity. To the extent that we could solve for snacks, maybe solve for that might be just ordering instacart or something to mine. Or I have a trader Joe is actually about two minute walk that way. I could walk to there if I knew exactly what to get. Or ideally I would have someone go to the shop, do the shopping for me, and deliver it. So I'd love to get really creative here and try to solve for these things.

And if so, when that, then that then basically gets us to understand, like, what do they think about it? Baseline. If they do, they recommend people to seek out this type of support and when. So then we can basically gauge what their kind of level of maturity is. And when thinking about this, if they have a really solid response, we can mirror. We just mirror. We're like, yeah, actually, you're absolutely right. Here's maybe another thing to think that they may be like, yeah, I've seen some of my founders who are scaling really fast when they need support with management, scaling their management skills. Absolutely. We see this all the time. This happens after post series a. We actually have a, basically a pool of folks who are dedicated to exclusively this. What we call them is executive coaches.

So the tools of it's real about being open to market feedback and having the confidence and decisiveness to be able to make high quality decisions with the feedback they're getting.

vi5R4N92m3GJC6XbBpmbrDAs,131,54:51.762,56:55.466,AJ Goldstein,"Yeah. So the answer is that there used to be an executive coaching network at a 16 z. A lot of coaches were added in 2015 to 2016. We've been matched. They matched them since then with mostly mentors, not executive coaches, when their experience has been that they basically have sort of had a network, no longer have it, and now don't actively seek founders to seek. Don't actively encourage founders to seek it at all. The way this team works, the talent team is they're hearing about it on the rare occasion that a founder asks their investor or the GP, the GP then relays it to the talent team. And the talent team now have a project that has been created or task, which is to do whatever the fuck the founder needs from the GP. The GP doesn't have time to deliver on tasks get created. Now there's also one other person in the talent team who's assigned to the founder, who supposedly meets with the founder on an ongoing basis. And the founder tells them, I need to hire a CRO, I need to hire a COO. And the talent team is like, great, we can help you with that. Help you find a new vendor to do new financial bookkeeping. Great, we can find you that. But being realistic for a second, what I found out, what more or less got became apparent on the call, is that the founder is not sharing with the talent team that they need a coach that is way too vulnerable. What they're going to share with the GP and the GP is sometimes, probably very rarely going to ever bring it to the talent team because it's one of those things. They don't trust the talent team knowing that the talent doesn't have the ability. So the talent team is going to think, oh, our founders aren't asking for it, when in fact what's really happening is that they aren't trusted.

So Pablo and I have been talking about his role not in terms of what is business development, but more of where is the handoff in the things that he works on. So, for example, we had a call on Wednesday morning with your bao. Right. And they went through this long process of analysis and they have selected sense to be their initial exclusive partner to integrate with their API to control their machines. Now. They want us to do it not in the US but in international. They are finding pilot locations and we're basically going to create a mobile app for digital payments using the Xirbao API infrastructure and be able to process digital mobile payments for laundry. They're going to use us for maybe exclusively for six months and then assuming we do well, we'll be their preferred partner. Even if and when they open their API further to other providers. And then alliance, we're working on a deal with them still in the infancy about basically white labeling our kiosks and then we have the call center and then we have eventually group purchasing and a lot of these things Pablo will not take to all the way through.

For example like tide is a great thing that like you and Gilly are really, really driving. Which makes sense to me because the time horizon on Tide is probably more than a year, right? Like I think that's where that like that's gonna be. The thing I really look at is like time horizon. Cause like I'm looking at stuff like quarter at a time or hopefully I get a little bit bigger and I think a half a year at a time. I'm not thinking month anytime anymore, but I'm. We're in that window of that. So something like call center that feels like something that as soon as it's out of beta should be on my plate extremely quickly because the time horizon of that product is very short. As in we will start selling it imminently. When I got here with connect or when we came in with laundrowworks, the time horizon for Laundryworks was very, very quick. Like it was a. A marketable, meaningful product early. So I grabbed it a lot earlier than other things. Things like Tide, Grabow, alliance, those things that have more like six to twelve month time horizons. Like that's where I'd consider the gray area. So let's go back to the question. It's when it becomes, let's call it market impacting is sort of how I've been mentally thinking about what projects to grab faster. Because something like even automatic, like automatic was like that line between I didn't know what I didn't know. But I also had a feeling that probably within a reasonable time horizon, theyd be a revenue customer. And it looks like I made that balance. Okay. So thats why I grabbed multiunit housing from Pablo pretty quickly, because I felt the time horizon to it being a market was pretty quick. So thats how I sort of think about what ive been grabbing from him and when ive been grabbing it. And not with any rhyme or reason, but like now I think about what I have grabbed. That's sort of been my litmus test.",114.12,376,0,25,0,1,28,0.2834586466165413,-0.23660150375939848,0.043699248120300745,37.699999999999996,-31.467999999999996,5.811999999999999,133,197.68664563617244

But yes, I agree that I think with some of these things, with Pablo, particularly in call center, we should probably bring you in not to not even just call it fully own, but at least have a piece or at least provide feedback into pricing and go to market strategy because Pablo is running a lot of that now, not pricing as much on more meat. So I'm thinking, do you think it's, once it's out of beta with x amount of customers, with a product that we can sell, is it on the earlier side? Because I also want to be sensitive to your time. I want to be sensitive to all the things that you can be looped in on.",58.49000000000001,142,0,3,0,1,6,0.30832558139534894,-0.15381395348837212,0.046511627906976764,13.258000000000004,-6.614000000000001,2.000000000000001,43,145.66592579928192

I'm going to do it. And I've seen you doing that, I want to say, which I appreciate that. Yeah. So I keep going back to call center's example. Like, for me, like, I actually do want some input on the product as a whole because I think I also have a vision of what's sellable and what the customer needs. That's one where like I've sort of been kind of poked and be like, hey, bring me in a little bit earlier on this one. Because like, I do think when that is ready for prime time, it's ready for prime time. Like, I will sell the shit out of that product. And so like it's, that's, I keep going back down to time Horizon. It's like, how do I think the time horizon on this is, is the biggest one for me? So I do actually think that being involved in call center at like, let's say like maybe at an advisory role in the beginning, but there's a moment where I'm like, I got this. And you don't want to go from not being an advisor to I got this. There's sort of a gradient there. And I think we all knew call center was going to be a pretty quick spin up project. I do think it makes sense to involve me more in that one. But the alliance, the garbage, the things that those things have time horizons that are incredibly long, I think, until thats almost a ready to be sold product, its sort of just like a, its a its a beta product more than anything else right now.

To me, it's actually not the usual sales role. The usual sales role. I have to be Switzerland. But I think good senior sales leadership can be the ones that are Switzerland saying we have. Alex is going to be pushing what are the fucking company goals at a big level with all these different kind of. The customer is going to dig their heels in, as you said, and want what they want. You need to find a way to thread the needle between the two in one that's highly accretive for both parties. And then you get to play good cop, bad cop on all sides. But we haven't necessarily had, we actually really haven't had that dynamic so much in the business. Haven't had that ability to have that dynamic so much in the business. And I think. I think that is super important as we think about more of the creative opportunities that we start to explore. So, anyway, I completely agree with that.

What can you commit to? What needs to be true? What do I want to see? And how do you be Switzerland to get what Lawrence and myself and the board and all of us want, versus what's possible, what you can deliver. But I think in relation to the go to market motion on some of these, where does sales sit? And let me rephrase it. Where does go to market sit in some of these bigger strategic opportunities?

The chief of staff goes from strategic project to strategic project, which is absolutely has it. But yeah. When I'm old one day, that's my. That's my. That's my old person executive job. So that. That. That. So this is also too. Is like. It's even as I would like to have this meeting, you, pablo can book it. I'll. Whatever works for you works for me. Like, it's stuff where if you told me does whatever we're talking about grabow. Or delivering, like, group purchasing. The time on a group purchasing is much shorter. I also think it's way more sellable and it would get us money on a time horizon we care about a lot quicker. And I do think having conversations about stuff like that, as in like, hey, we have these eight projects. They have different time horizons, like grabow or alliance integration that was meaningful over the long term, is incredibly strategic and has value. But is that the time horizon we care about right now? And starting to have those philosophical debates. Cause, like, as soon as, like, so Gilly grabbed me when we were in New York for maybe the board meeting. We just grabbed dinner like one night. Cause we were both there and he's like, what are we not doing? And I was like, I literally looked at him like, blankly and I was like, I've been so heads down on what we are doing. I was like that. I literally haven't picked my head up to ask myself, like, what's the next product we should be creating? So I spent some time thinking about it and actually I went through, like, Dave's book and stuff like that. And I was like, I looked at call center. I'm like, everyone is paying reception hq or one phone or just having to. Like, it's clearly a problem. They're paying other people to solve it or solving in a really crappy way. Even if we did it okay, we'd be good. So I was like, I gave it to Gilly. That's Gilly call center. And so that starts spinning up and it's like, I haven't heard anything about call center. It's like, I have strong opinions about call center also, like, pricing is important. I also think if we could snap our fingers and roll out a product that we were happy with tomorrow, I really think I could go into our base and sell hundreds of these pretty quickly.

And now one of our reps in indie, who sells indie customers is gonna. Anyway, look, the as far, this is how I've always thought about our business.

It's very linear from the perspective where, like, it's very. Clear what we need to build to get to that next phase to get to that next.

But, like, one thing I've realized about the POS is, like, when you buy a Pos, it's like buying a gym membership. You are signing on for work. So if you're already doing this on another system, cool. You're. You're buying a shovel for something you already do. If you're doing a pen and paper, you're buying a snowblower. When you're using a shovel, terrific. If you're not doing it today, that's our riskiest customer, because now it's like, am I going to market? I'm going to do whatever. And, like, our subscription is dependent on their willingness to be committed to going to the gym three days a week and eating. Right, right. Things like call center is a. When it plugs in, they delegate everything to us and it works like magic, and it takes weight off their plate instantly. And they feel so much better the day it goes live. And they do nothing differently except for answer the phone when we ring it to them. That's it. The value there has so much. It's like, I want to use, like steroids. That's a bad example here. It's like morphine. It's like the pain goes away immediately. The POS is work. So that wedge is kind of a weird wedge because it's designed that if they don't do their job, we fail. Where things like call center or why I think launderworks works as well as it does is even if they don't have to do anything besides pay their bills, orchestrate what's going on, and fill the card reader. That's it. Okay. The car dispenser. The POS is a right price point, but it is a gym membership, which is why it has all the attributes of a gym membership. Call center. And products like call center or inventory management or stuff like that are products that they get morphine. We just inject it. They say, yes, they give us permission and do you want the pain to come back or not? And I think that's why I like products like call center is like, it just feels like very. It's a wedge that doesn't require work.",103.16000000000008,371,0,25,0,2,35,0.2623511450381679,-0.12364885496183212,0.052030534351145054,34.367999999999995,-16.198000000000008,6.8160000000000025,131,215.7813105854981

The website could have been that if we did it right the first time, hopefully we'll do it right the second time. Website can, the website I think can be like that. And there are, there are other ones, I mean, there are other ones that I think one of the big ones I want to do next year is real estate. I want to have a zillow like marketplace where somebody inside of sense can say I'm selling my store or I'm looking to buy. And then we can have an actual marketplace product using an online tool. We don't have to really manage it, but we have actual marketplace product where brokers can be certified and look at. And you have this map of all the stores, just laundromats that are being sold. Not on a biz by sale, not just laundromats. And you have the ones that are scent certified, meaning their data is validated versus ones that are. But again, a wedge to get people to be going onto the cents website, to be going on and engaging with our product and being aware of what we're doing without begging them to do it. And the other side before we have to jump here, is also brand and marketing. I do think that next year, like I think I told you this, that on laundry day, which is April 15, I want to have billboards up for one week, maybe two in all, the major metros in Manhattan, Chicago, San Francisco, La, Miami, cost maybe ten grand, 15 grand for a day, two days, whatever it looks like. And I just want to have a giant sign that says WDF question mark and a logo. I mean, QR code. And I want it to be a really cool squarespace designed website. Doesn't need to be fancy, but really cool website. That's all about promoting the point of local. And what is that of supporting local. Because the next product, similar to call center that will be a fucking game changer is when we actually hire all the drivers for delivery. Imagine everyone have to use gig, but we have 20 vans running in New York and they're all wrapped and branded as send your laundry out. Support local businesses. Scan the QR code to order from your local laundromat. And then when you scan that code, it just fills in a Google search of local laundromats around me. Nothing sense related. Use whatever you want. But if you're a sense customer, you don't have to rely on Doordash. You don't have to rely on Uber eats. You don't have to rely on all that shit.

Like, you could filter it however you like and you'll learn how to do that over time. But just pulling leads, I mean, you could really do, however, like you want laundromat, that same laundry or you want whatever XYZ. You could pull in as many or as little as you want at any given time. I usually pull on like 51. I pull in 50. I work them. Once I work them so they're done. I pull another 50. Once they're in your queue, you get your own queue. Come new and work move daily. It's. You just. It's pretty simple. You just check them all. Then you import it to outreach. You click this button, and then it just kind of shows up here. And then you check them all. And then you choose. You'll see. You'll learn this as a later training, but you just pull it in. You choose what kind of sequence you want to put it in. And there's different sequences, and you get the hang of it. So these are the sequences I use the most, or these are the ones I made. And you'll see there's some default ones as well. Just depends on what you need to do with it. And you take some time to look at what each sequence does, and then you put it in and it's just all automated from there on the. And say you're done working it. You could always finish it early so it doesn't keep coming back. I mean, this is stuff that you'll come to figure out, but it's all pretty straightforward. But, yeah, for the most part, you choose how much leads you want to pull in, choose exactly what leads you want to pull in, and then you put in.

Usually you pull it in and pull in your name, but I'm the only one that's working anyway. So you pull it into your name and then you put it in a sequence. Okay. But there's a lot of different lists just for now. Our focus is the sales queue, which is like, completely code straight from Google. But, you know, there's. There's a lot. There's like, laundryworks users, there's people who filled out a certain form. This is from planet laundry tax guide. And there's a lot of different filters where they could come from. Once you get a hang of filtering, you can literally pick any kind of lead you want. And that's why, if we get notes put in the notes and we can also filter by the things put in notes like what type of pos, they're using, their wash and fold self service. So I'll typically, if it's like a somewhat of good lead, then I will put in if they do wash and fold or self service.

I really like it. Hopefully going forward, these processes we can make as like streamlined and easy. Right now, I think it's a little hard because there's a lot of back and forth required or. Yeah, back and forth required. And I think when it comes to the sales team making sure that they understand these services when they're selling them will be super helpful and making sure the operators, when I'm working, working with them, kind of know what I'm referencing, because I think that's where things can get lost in translation.

Some people do card, but it's kind of difficult because it's like, really, what kind of card and where does it go? And, you know, is it just, just visa card, whatever, with the penny pulse? Is that something that needs to have like the tablet and all of that stuff set up as the station or can they just get the penny pulse and put it on their machines?

So what's kind of unique is, I would say for like the whole time I've worked at scents, the focus has pretty much been wash, dry, fold, wash, dry, fold. And then when we formally launched penny and pulse, it actually enabled self serve customers. So customers that have no desire to hire attendance and be involved in folding clothes, to also come onto scents. So they get most of the functionality that they could access from a tablet, from the sense business manager. But most of those people never buy tablets. You know, there's no one in store to remotely start machines. If anything, they're going to be remotely starting them from home or what have you. But, yeah, we oftentimes have self serve customers or self serve launch mats that come. I speak to them a couple of times and then for the most part, they don't really have as many touch points as our other users do. I tend to like them a lot. They're very easy clients for the most part. I can't say we've had too much experience in laundry rooms yet. I would say that's more like laundry works domain. Since they have a kiosk, their product has been out longer. So we've gone through like various iterations.

Ultimately, they made the decision to stop kind of creating more compatibility for the penny and just work on stabilizing the product as much as possible because we kind of started running before we can walk as any good startup does. So, yeah, just working right now to stabilize the product. And I'd say it's more likely that we develop another device as opposed to continuing to develop on the penny.

But technically, as the rule book says, whatever rule book that is, it should be getting delivered to the distributor. Not to get too granular about it, but essentially, the operator would need to get special permission from their distributor to have our sense equipment directly shipped to them. And I think that the wires get crossed there sometimes because there's no standard right now of who is the main point of contact for the distributor in between the operator. And so everyone's just kind of like, we've lost equipment before because of this.

So my and also doing a lot of this in excel is very complicated in that it's just going to require more people. If we want to do it right and we don't want to do it with a system, it's just going to require more people. Matt did ping me this morning. He's going to make some comments on that file that Ali sent over to really get you all an idea of where to elaborate, shall I say, on the need for erpat. And, like, where it can go, where. Where we really need it, where our risk are, and where it would be like, okay, maybe you could do this later. Maybe you can do this now. There are definitely some areas where I feel like we should highlight, especially if we want to be real serious. And that's revenue and inventory. Those are going to be your biggest items that are going to be on audit anyway. Revenue is always your largest item. We have a ton of revenue streams. Um, from a technical accounting perspective, things get very convoluted. I. Bridget and I talked about this before, and to be fair, it's a little scary. So we kind of just dropped it. But from a technical accounting perspective, when we're dealing with hardware, software payments that are all very intertwined, it does get complicated. You really have to look at a contract and understand, hey, how do I really allocate the revenue of this contract? Even though census telling me they spent $20,000, or they sold these penny devices for $20,000, but they gave away free implementation and free SaaS? That means that a lot of that $20,000 value needs to be allocated. And it also depends on how are these items separate. This is where Matt and I were chatting yesterday on our proprietary hardware, our connect, our laundry work stuff. This could get complicated from a revenue perspective if we cannot prove that the software and hardware are two separately identifiable objects. Without going too much into detail, it would basically just mean, like, if we have hardware, that is a means to get to software. It requires us to actually spread that revenue out from a hardware perspective as well.",123.93799999999999,399,1,15,0,2,29,0.2329606299212598,-0.1405039370078741,0.12058267716535433,29.585999999999995,-17.844000000000012,15.314,127,193.16109667737098

There are like five different things that you have to go through a contract to determine are these separate blah, blah, blah. I think it's worth it for us to do it so that we know we're doing it right on all. We just have so many different revenue streams, and I think it's worth it for them to really sit down and say, yes, this is the way that we should look at revenue from a connect perspective and from a laundry works perspective.

Because from a technology perspective, what we're working on, all of that one, Deloitte also is supposed to give us slight direction on the strategy they're trying to implement. And then based on that, we can go a certain direction. Meaning if we move. If we move off from Laura Jackson, we want to hire an additional person. Do we do that in Canada? Do we do that in the US? We do that in the US because the capacity of Canada is no longer to be able to handle additional sales volume driven by the US. So the US entity needs to take that on and invest further. Means we are increasing our own costs, which means that revenue should be moving over here because it previously, historically, could not be captured in Canada. Right? Payments. When we revolutionized payments with laundryworks, they were breaking experience, like threatening churn. All that. We spent five months negotiating a contract, building a new integration. All of that could be, or at least a vast majority of it, should be our revenue.

They do have some strategies with it. They wanted to understand exactly what you're just saying.

From a technical accounting perspective to deliver as well and keep it on file, because this will not be the first, this won't be the last time that we need it. It'll come up in audit as well, especially the transfer pricing stuff. So it's the more strategy we can get in writing in a memo type form to say, hey, look, this is our plan. This is how we're justifying this. This is what we're doing. The better off we're going to be. So I think that let's get some of these questions answered. I am happy and I'll chat with Matt.

One, I think is the sophistication of pizza shop owners. And then the purpose. The purpose is not to give insights that a pizza shop owner is going to look at slice of the union and say, wow, I can now use this data to run a better business.

Using your meetings to see your tone, your this or that. My feedback to him was. My feedback to him was like, dude, will people change what they say to me if they see there's a note taker app? Will it? And like, will I remember or will I change the way I speak to you? Because there's a note taker app? When I would maybe something, I would say something different because like, we're casual and friendly. But then I'm like, this is going to be my game tape recorded in the meeting. So then I'm acting differently. So I don't necessarily know, but I told him I try it. He needs like five meetings for it to like calibrate my style or something. So that. Okay, keep going. So the basic premise is that I just spend the last hour this morning, like, actually going through all these things. And like, the mission statement here is rather than just listen about how AI is sort of changing the world, which inevitably it is for companies like IBM or united or whatever, like me as my worker in my day to day life, how can I leverage tools that are at a certain level now that actually make my work easier or more efficient, whatever. Without, like, cheating, right? Without just like, not thinking? So here's awesome ones. And I genuinely think that we should have like an AI protocol at a sense where someone or some body of brain think tank here is thinking about how to do this in a company wide, effective way. It'll just literally make everyone work. You and Ally. I don't know who else would do this. Yeah, exactly. Or like someone like, you know, maybe it's like a committee that spends an hour over lunch doing this is like in half an hour. Look at this stuff. Literally already in our literature. So on a personal level, this one is hilarious. It's basically just like an AI vibe for every episode that Andrew Kubernetes every day. And so, because who wants to listen to these fucking 3 hours? It's kind of like, have you ever seen the unroll app on Twitter? If you respond at unroll, it will go through the entire thread of somebody's tweets and put it into a document and then you can click on it. Yeah, there you go. What's the best routine in the morning to have a product. They're just like scans, not just humans. Yeah, but like, you know, other podcasts, I guess. So, like, this is like a fun school personal hack website builder I haven't done yet. Let's see. But is this wetland durable. I know that our team spends, even if it's templated, a lot of time. Don't fucking do this. Right, so let's see. And by the way, a lot of these, like, there's generally, I found two types of like AI online. There's like do it for you cheap and dirty or you pay and you pay and you have a lot more input so you can like customize build templates, right? So I, okay, not mind blowing, but by the way, this is exactly what I do to sites, right? So maybe we like give inputs and like, you know, have templates, but it just walked in the fucking turns. What? In the fucking turns, basically, yeah, but like, it's these tools. These tools are meant to reduce repetitive, mundane tasks, right? So I haven't done this one yet, but it's, these are two of the same, it's like presentation creators. So I just was messing around with one. So I was doing research last time on elder care industry. Insane. So I just went on chat GPT and I asked it to give me an overview of the elder care industry. And then my second thought was one of the biggest gaps and it literally, it's absolutely right. I'm not. Okay, this is an insane opportunity for someone to go in with elder. So I literally just copied and visited this entire thing in here and in 10 seconds created this entire presentation. And there was hundreds of templates that I could have picked from. You know, I literally just clicked like a theme of text and stuff like this and it put this whole thing together. You know, granted I input the text from chat to d, but you can cross pollinate different AI things. So it was slight buck. So like, yeah, all of these, there's like five or six big players, all in multi billion dollars annual revenue. And like this is like a common AI thing where like it doesn't really do well with text in indian images, but whatever that means. So like think about this element of elder care, personalized AI care, right? So you use an AI element to basically personalize the care and attention. And you can even like on one end of the spectrum, it's like AI enabled augmented communication between family and elders. Like loneliness is a thing of daughter, but then you also have personalization if you introduce like a healthcare, healthcare provider and you introduce like a personalized medication and like wellness and eastern medicine into this. And the big trend is out of home care, so people want to stay in place. So you have like, you create efficiencies of having a workplace. Or something goes, they have personal reschedules. They know, to be honest. But yeah, here's my only thing with these is, I think it's a scary point because there's this great tweet and blog from the guy who did Harry stemmings that does the 20 BC. 20 BC. And the thing is, like, AI is making entrepreneurship so, so easy that people look at starting companies as the secure and stable way of getting into the workforce versus, like, willing to kill yourself and slog and hate everything. And like. And so it's gonna build, it's kind of like weak times build weak Mendez. Weak men create hard times. Hard times create strong men, strong men create weak time, whatever the quote is. And so my only so on some things, I think where I want both sense and then me personally to be leveraging AI is to make my, is to make myself better in building routines, in cooking and eating, in health, and things that, like, if I, if it became easier for me, I might do it more. Versus, and same with sense, if we, if we make it easier for ourselves to do the hard things versus make the easy things that much easier. Now. And I've used chat GPT on our thing about data. There are some elements that I used chat GPT for, but. So I very much agree with all that. But I see that as a positive because AI is theoretically a step change up in speed and efficiency from just like knowing how to use the Internet, right? Like ten years ago, if you want to start a company and you knew your way around data visualization tools and research, and you know how to like, raise money, things like that, you would get an advantage. Now, actually, a good analogy is in the filmmaking industry. When my first company was production company and we rode the wave of the fact that camera technology was so good that for $5,000 I could buy in camera that looked like a $150,000 camera. But the benefit is that it weeds out the moments. Sure, anyone can start a company. You can build a website, you can do research, you can make a deck in 1 minute, but are you capable of actually operating building company? I bet you we're going to see a massive spike in entrepreneurship and companies that start and an even bigger spike in companies that fail with it, which is not a benefit to anybody. It's a benefit, well, lose money, you have shitty competition, that's noise. You get all these things. They don't have. I mean, the real entrepreneurs will use this to not generate ideas. But like, for example, what I, what I wanted to charge is like, it's just, okay, let's, how do we use this? Like, I don't want to make a residential grip, right. Leverage our tool by garment care services to the residents and. All right, let's just see what it says. So small pound. See what this thing says. Matter. So to your point, it's not to do work that you didn't know how to do or weren't during. It's to make our lives ten x easier by instead of me spending 3 hours making this deck, I do this in 30 seconds and then edit it and send it off so that you and I are using our fucking brains, not our fingers. So there's a kind of sick example sentence. I mean, this is not so different. I know, than what we fucking made ourselves. So here, here's the reason. So I like it. I'll tell you why I don't like it. The only reason I don't like it is for people that don't have the knowledge of these things. If you can't make the deck, if you can't make it, this is, I think, harmful. I know. This is exactly what we wrote. Exactly. And I just copied it up there. It's actually crazy what you say on the call. It's really true. My only concern, again, my concern is if we don't have the ability to go any deeper than what an AI does for us, then I think all we're doing is making it so we can, so we become reliant on other tools. But I agree with this thing is if we need to like pump out a bunch of shit, we know it really well. Like for example, when I made the deck about data protection, leveraging, et cetera, a lot of the slides I took from chatgpt or I found a blog, I put it into chat GPTs, I rewrite it and I put it in because I knew enough to where to your point, you know enough about the multifamily laundry, real estate, et cetera, you can do this. And this is a time saving, exactly. But there's a lot of people that would do this because they were given a prompt and something to do. They put this together and they'd have no depth and understanding. I think the criteria for using this is you need to then edit it. If you can't, if neither of us have any edits to this, that's a problem. That's my point. Right. And then the other thing is you should be using it for things that you are in expert in, purely to save time, which is you're saying. But I also think that, like, again, my concern is when things get really easy, the way that you care about them, the effort, the all of that become, I think, slightly less it's in relationships, it's with everything. The easier things get, the less you'll care about making an effort. And so that's my, and I think it's what we talk about in sense all the time. The more we automate our campaigns, the more we automate everything, the less high touch we're going to be with our customers. Are there ways to automate? Like all of our onboarding, all of our messaging, all of our everything, 100%. I don't want to do that because everybody can automate. It will eventually become a luxury to feel a personal white glove touch a deck for a fucking random property management group. This is epic. Well, because you know everything about it. You can get on a sales call, never look at this and know everything that's in this back, you know, like the back of your hand. Somebody like a CS person making a website for an operator after their fifth or 10th website. Yeah. Fucking use AI. Yeah, absolutely. And I think that like this, it should be tactile, but also on the other side. So research for you, right? Like this one, I'm not. This one's a little more complicated, like, probably advanced, where you actually need to, like, put in code. I just grabbed one of their templates. So, like, research market research. You know, for a lot of stuff I'm thinking of, like, I know that I need to research this, but I don't always know all the different elements. And you learn that by point threads, right? Traditionally, if I spent a week researching call center technology, I would eventually talk to ten customers to figure out which ones they're using. Research those find who's innovating the space using AI. Whether it's tragic video, which is still my favorite, or some of these more advanced ones, you can learn a lot more quickly, but it should never supplant your directive. You need to be able to, you need to use these as tools, not like just handing off work. Right. And then we also have to make sure that whatever the data that AI is getting is active. No, it's really just. So this one is interesting, adds to sources. This is like a more, this one is billed as more of like a research. No, I just use it as research. But like create a bot so you can automate that. So it's like maybe think like AI needs to save here. So I just put in a research prompt. But you can actually plug in different tools that might have an automated task. This is like a GPT generator. So you can build a GPT, which visit is like the engine, AI engine, so you can direct it at whatever tasks you want. So this could be something. For example, if I'm creating weekly reports for call center, right, you plug in. It's sort of like metabase. Yeah, it meets chat JpG. I could tie it to my excel export and have it like email customers a formatted report, things like that. This one I think is a really cool one for Sivan. You screen record anything and then it creates a step by step how to guide. So like for example, for sense Assist, I'm getting on call today to figure out does I never use Google Voice before, like the Google free phone line? Oh, I have, right. But it's honestly very similar to Dialpad. Yeah, but it's just like, you know, I had to get on. I spent 45 minutes yesterday with one of our customers who was using Google Voice to connect to send the stairs. And we figured out that you can't use the personal line because it screens call centers and you can't afford a personal line with same thing. If I want to use. Sometimes if I want to use dial pad as a phone number for some app or something, it screens, it knows the iPad is a whatever number so it won't set the automatic verification. Exactly. But it took me 45 minutes of settings. Right. And so now we learned you have to pay $10 a month for Google Business to use call center. So I want to go into voice and create a step by step guide for when you're setting up but when do we want to just say, don't use Google Voice in this? Yes, eventually. Right now, in this early phase. Oh, we don't have the way to give them the information that Google voice. Right. Well, we eventually will give them a phone number eventually. But right now, because we want to be flexible, we're asking them to set up a forwarding number so we can. Right now they use Comcast or Google Voice to forward to AWS. Opposed to us owning the phone. Right. Cause. Cause then if we wanna make a change, then. But for any, any product we set up this, you know, a lot of feedback I see from customers is very like, our onboarding is white love, but sometimes it's not as intuitive. Do you know, do you know loom? One of our investors was the really big, was there led their c brown. So I don't know if they're doing this kind of stuff. I know loom is great for like video recording, but that's still a manual what versus. Right. So like, let's say it just captures a tab and then does your voice. So I would do this. Oh, and then does it like transcribe if I. I'm gonna hit record and then I just go do the thing one time. It records it and then turns it into a step by step guide and. Oh, it automatically says this is what you did in this video. Yeah. And it turns it into something you can use for customers. Right. So, like, if I hit record now and then I went to Google Voice, set up a phone number, the one time you would turn that into a how to guide and video for people. Right. So like, that, this is like a great, you know, example of like you're just saving. So just some. Oh, and then this is the other thing. So this is the company that. This is my like one AI investment. And I'm so mad. I gave this guy ten grandd because he like crushed Y combinator. Like everyone. All the investors gave him $25,000 checks for. He built like a chap CPT just for financial research. So for like mid market PE guys who wanted like a dedicated thing, he had paying customers bank like $250,000 annual contracts. And then he pivots out of fucking nowhere in the third investor letter to a text to video AI in general. That looks so shitty. And now they're working on it. Sure. But, you know, so I'm like, kind of write that down to zero. But on the other hand, last night I was having some fun thinking, okay, if I made a YouTube channel, something like that's guaranteed to get a lot of pics. Like, Jenny's in business school, right? And she's already blown me up. Her Excel class is horrible. She wants my help with Excel. Or like, Nick. My friend Nick went to law school and they're doing tons of research. What if I made a YouTube channel for a niche topic that was like, you know, something guaranteed to get a lot of recurring, not just like content, but like research. I literally just chat like you know, I was thinking, like, legal research, right? So I chatted to what was one of the most inflammable Supreme Court cases through the prompt in here, and five minutes later, spit out a little video, established the right to an attorney for all criminal defendants, regardless of their ability to. In 1961, Clarence Earl Gideon was charged with breaking and entry in Florida. Unable to afford a lawyer, inexperienced to defend himself, and was convicted. Gillian appealed his case to the Supreme Court, arguing that the 6th Amendment guaranteed his right to counsel. In a unanimous decision in 1963, the court agreed and mandated that states provide attorneys for defendants. Okay, so, looks shitty. And honestly, they're improving the product. It's probably really good for schools. So what about for our help set our blog, right? What if embedded in each help center about how to do marketing for laundry? Sometimes people like watching a short video, right? Like, you just copy the article into this thing. It spits out a two minute video that someone can watch while they're doing laundry. You know, like, that's, that's interesting. You know, so I was thinking, start a YouTube channel and just like once a day just upload a random video. And so, in summary, all this is to say that, like, I have a very newfound appreciation for actually researching what AI tools publish. Thousands are released every day, are, like, actually beneficial to our daily lives, not, you know, the next big thing that's going to run a business for me. But, like, how do we as a company, create 30% efficiency? By automating a lot of these tasks and making the quality better. Yeah, no, I mean, I agree. I think this is a cool, cool thing for you and for, uh. Yeah, I think this is a cool thing for both you and Ally to work on because I think, I mean, Allie has a lot of this overloaded a lot of stuff, but I think she knows the, she has, like, the engineering behind her to be able to actually implement some of these things. But even, like, what Brian Harzock did with the Cesare whatever, like, basic, but he did it. He's a fucking Cs guy. So, you know, I mean, the phone call where it's my voice. Wait a second, I wasn't full. Yeah, I wasn't full either, but it still, like, worked for like, 30 minutes of training and remarkable for that. Yeah. So, you know, and also, like, everyone's talking about AI, AI, laundry, whatever. Like, we are very uniquely positioned to provide real tools with AI, not just, like, having a chat about integration. I think that there's a lot to be discovered and how we can do this for longer operators and really lean into automating their businesses for them. Accounting stuff, you know, the demographics, not entirely right to just like certainly get on a day, even if it was just like a monthly podcast that you did send subs talking about how AI can factor launch mat and we just highlight different AI tools. You reinvent the term AI, you know, executives or sales people from their companies, they just talk about how AI is impacting small businesses and that's like your content that you're putting out in the industry. You can do YouTube videos for sense, talking about AI and AI's impact and things like that. You totally do that on like a monthly or five days. I think it'd be cool. I think, you know, it'd be fun to like turn it into a channel. But even like this, frankly, is the one I'm most excited about because visual information is a benefit for anyone and we make a lot of presentations. I think it's especially good for a chart. Like if you want to make a presentation that's being internally, it's like just talk about it better and I'm sure if there's a premium version of it, you can give it like your brain guidelines. Yeah, exactly. Um, cool. Anyways, that's, that's my love dissertation this morning. Love. This is really, I'm so like, I haven't invested in anything and I think it's kind of like crypto almost to me, where it's like I don't know enough. I have one, I don't know enough, and two, I'm like, I like, I like doing and I have a discomfort with putting in and not doing. And it makes me feel, it just makes me feel like I don't know what I'm doing. And I like putting, I like hating doing. I hate making all these different versions of the deck, hate thinking about all the language I'm using in every painstaking, every email, every word. Now I, and then I just use Grammarly. Grammarly as opposed to AI where like Grammarly rewrites me. I just don't like it. It doesn't have my tone in the way that I would write and so, but that's, but I'm sure that's like a limited factor. I think it's just what we were saying before. It's like anyone who's using this to get work, to get critical thinking, work off their plate is using a bond. It should be an augmented age, as we were. Yeah. Or even like thought starters. Right? Like, you know, some of the best ideas I have come from conversation with people when like, I think out loud, I think much better out loud than just like sitting there, you know, or like on a whiteboard. So if you now have an interface to like, bounce ideas off, it stimulates your creative thinking a lot. And then sure, it dumps it into a nice looking deck or website or process or whatever. But like, the thing. I'll say this, the thing that has surprised me the most about AI as it's emerged in the last year is how quickly it's gotten to a point where I actually trusted. Versus just like a year ago, chattoogated was just like, generic comps. And it's like, oh, wow, it's summarizing Google homepage for me now. It's like, oh, I did not even think about that. And it's responding to me in a way that feels like a sort of haptic interface for my output, not necessarily just like a cuter Google. So that's very cool. Okay, what else? I'm meeting with Lawrence in 15 minutes about the off grand stuff. Okay. So we'll hopefully have a plan there. And then chatting with the Om guys at 330. At 330? Yeah. To kind of, like, get a sense of what their needs are and how critical. Okay. Okay. And then, so what else do we need? Are you targeting a certain amount of people you want in a call center beta? So originally we're just gonna set and forget it. Five people. But since we're only focusing on the automated IVR, we theoretically could scale up to 50 if we wanted to. And it's free ish, where people would pay, like $20 a month. Just the automation. The only concern there would be when we want to port this into our business, like, makes it with accelerate or do a 2.0. Are we buying a small of having more people? But I don't see any risk in this. Slowly. Like, anyone who's interested is getting on board. They don't need to charge or anything right now. As long as they know that we could flip a billing search later on. It'd be pretty sick to say in the first 450 people, so. Okay, so do you want me to. Do you want me to look at the. I mean, I would call Walid. I don't really trust him, but I could call Walid. I could call Matt Walshmidt. I didn't reward our. You went on the community, by the way. Laundry, taxi. I didn't realize it, so I want. It's crushing. Well, it's around my house. Oh, it's a real store. I thought he was a direct to consumer Sal. Whatever. Stevon sends her. Yeah, he's awesome. Gets too large from my house. Oh, no way. They have lawn words and cents. I thought he was. I thought Sal was. Oh, maybe his friend, the director consumer. April, actually, I'll get the top 20 people. Oh, Reggie would 100% do it, by the way. You should call Reggie Swain again. He would fucking love this. Well, I mean, I'm sure we have it. Backend. Let me look at. I think I'm an admin ad filter. The other thing that I think we should talk about is, oh, by the way, with Daisy, we now have six buildings and five in the next week. They have. They gave us six new buildings. We're going to go just, um. Just, uh, door to door service with a seven to 09:00 a.m. governor from Jason and Uber's address. But they have six buildings living in a cluster of each other, and so Jason's just not. There's every morning, basically. So the bed is better for Jason. Yeah. So it's literally, it's 12345. Where's Jason's launch mat? It's 1234-561-2346 okay. That's not so bad. It's a 40 minutes drive home to get here and then 45 minutes loop plus 3 hours. 3 hours for six buildings. That's fine. And that's what we want. He said this is a month. He's not doing a lot of residential gig up delivery anyway right now. And. Cool. So we'll get those lines targeting Thursday. But I. Let's talk about our strategy with manufacturers, because that, I feel like, is kind of a black ops for a sale. And it's flipping away a little bit when it comes to alliance. Should I call what's his name right now? If not, we'll just go back to practicing. Who's testing for fucking Covid, by the way? What are you going to do? What are you going to do differently now? Leave a message or not. Hey, Alan, Alex Czykowski calling from sense. Hope all is well. Just thought I'd give you a ring to see how things are moving on your end. If you need anything from my side and if we should aim to reconnect this week or next. I remember you saying that this was a priority for you guys, so just thought I would check in. So look forward to hearing from you. All right, take it easy. Hello? I thought he might be calling on the other line and he wasn't. We got gearbow tomorrow. Tomorrow. Oh, yeah. So for tomorrow, do you think, does it make more sense if I meet you at your apartment and just check off? Yeah, I think. I mean, you can come to my apartment if you want to take the call from there, just go. I think that's easier. 750. That's great. And then we'll tell them we have to go at 845 for the 925 thing, pick us up, and then for this conference. This is the, this is going to be there. So, like, this is why I wanted you to go, because there's some companies I think would be good for you to. So Marriott International Bounce. Remember that company bounce? That's like, drop your bags here, I'll show you. But they weren't doing well. See the comments? So I'm just chat. I'm. All I'm doing is 410 to 455. And there's five companies. I'm going last because why? Okay, so booking palm distribution. Tech channel management solutions. Vacation rental industry. Interesting. Fueling energy transition. Mobile fueling less interesting. Kbounce powers 10,000 brick and mortar locations for local services, starting with luggage storage and package receiving. Nice. So usebounce.com dot. I think we chatted with them and then I know, honestly, people did it. But look, the idea is laundromats. Imagine we did a partnership with Bounce where we turned every one of our laundromats into a mouse. Location and luggage storage from 490 a day. Oh, yeah, we did. Did we chat with them or we thought about chatting with them. $10,000 production free cancellation. Yeah, yeah, we talked about this a while ago. I think it's a great idea. Great idea. So their founder will be there. Cody Candy Canary modernizing hotel Tech Stack Award winning guest management systems and digital authorization solutions cruise bound leading cruise online booking company travel expense management public sector nonprofits high growth small businesses count on your intelligent automation group size leading member management in person enterprise events with some solutions of venues vendors could do want, like could get all the laundry for all their vendors. Digital marketplace for the hospitality industry reshaping market b two b reservations remaining booking generated companies in there book a laundry pickup. Yeah, I'm just saying like all them have the volume of hotels. Life House Online hotel management brand software that makes boutique hotels ready for these like really high level integrations where it's like as a laundry as a rule of for travel booking. But if we found it's not about, we can say we're not ready, we just go to series b, we're building the biggest network. But the opportunity is there and it might not be now and they won't fucking, they're not going to roughly do it either. But if we can, if in your Rolodex, you know the founders of all these companies, and we can go top down and say, can you get us to all these hotels? Can we be your laundry provider? But also for like point of sale for booking management for hotels. That's great because then they can just be like, would you like to book a laundry when someone's checking these hotels do laundry now it's just really expensive because they have to send out. So maybe it's like more affordable. So vp of development innovation at Hill, this person had built at Dorado Beach Resorts and real estate. The principal there, investor Capital one Ventures, hospitality groups. So that's just like, you send me this. Yeah, I mean, I like that people know that deals are coming. We want people, we want sales. People have a touch of how they know. Wow, there's a McKinnon. And then you would just go, true. He could put, like, his own card. He would probably have to do, like, a border on behalf of. That feels sketchy. It's on his part. Like, I I wouldn't recommend that. It. That was funny. Is that not funny? Hey, he said he's no Brian Henderson. What? What a callback. Never forget. Here it is. Wait, I've been to Keynes. Your friendly owns Keynes. Hold on. Wait. Your friend owns Keynes? I've been to Keynes in Nashville. Hey, Kane's is great. Okay, wait, can't is great. I've actually. I have identified. I mean, cakes. Great. Cakes. Great. We work on one place called, like, something. Elissa, I'll call this. CRF if you have one that needs to approve. It. It. It. I know that it's a long meeting, but I wanted to follow up because we have something really, really exciting to show. It. Wait. Did nobody answer the phone? No, they did. What do you want? I'll order it. JK, I'm already placing it. Even needs getting you the new son of north soup. It's just the burrito, but without the tortilla. What? Soup del nor. Soup del nord. I present to you dignity blue. Oh, dignity blue. But I have none. What? That's right. You got to get it somewhere. Have we been using. No, Daniel. J. J's not the right loyal. Is that loyal what we did? No, none of them are. They look great. Well, my carnate saw this, Mike. Yeah. One, two. Does he like the carnage? Gentleman doing it for everybody. Okay, how many? Four. Kevin will want. You want. I want. Lawrence wants. Pablo will want. Ryan. Brooke, do you guys want a burrito? Okay, Brooke, Santa, you want one? Scholars and the burrito. Oh, she chooses violence. Steve on do you want a burrito? Stevon? Stevon, want a burrito? Do you want a burrito?

Okay, so there's kind of two concepts that we've discussed at times. One is a slice of the union, right? We're all familiar with slice of the union, correct? Yes, we're a slice of the union. And the other is the need and possibility for our company to provide really interesting industry insights that are actually literally impossible to get in any other environment. Self serve commercial pickup and delivery at the scale of operations, plus all the trends of inventory reporting in pounds per hour folded, and average volume and average amount of machines in a location, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, dry cleaning, laundry pickup, you know, all these, all these things. And so the concepts that we've thought about is. I'll bifurcate them. They're kind of the same, but I kind of see them differently. There's the direct to consumer y, fun, cool visuals and branded elements that is more slice of the union esque that I think can really be about supporting local, that is supporting local laundry. And I think sense in the coming years has a responsibility and a role in promoting the use of local laundromats, dry cleaners, leather cleaners, et cetera. And we can actually leverage the purchasing power of our locations to just say, send it out. We don't give a fuck who you send it out to, but send it out, and send it out local. And we can use this kind of slice of the union strategy on April 15, which is National Laundry Day. And I think there's, like, cool things that we can do in that vein. On the inverse of that, on the opposite side, there's more of industry trends and reports. So I've sent Laura a couple examples of that by Jobber by touch Bistro. And these companies are put out as it sounds. Let's see if I can show the blue collar report by Jobber. Now, Jobber doesn't hire a firm to go out and look at data. They'll do it all themselves, and they'll create a blue collar report. And this is a huge lead gen tool that companies will use and promote on their website. So you put their email, and then you get their report, and they did this off of, I don't remember how many. I think they said 600 on this one. I forget who it was, or maybe it was all their customers, I'm not 100% sure. And they do a really cool visualization, but it's much more insights driven. It's still nice and cool and well branded, and they have the shop talk and they have the cool little things. But it's 14 slides of their industry report at a high level. And so this is much different. The other example would be it the touch Bistro report. I don't. State of restaurants. House does. State of the industry. A lot of these companies, now this, I think they took 600 full service restaurant owners and then hired a firm. To go and do this with them. And then they created this big industry report thing and it's very data heavy and interesting. So from the perspective of the bobbins, the Brian Riselons, the Jason worms, I think they would eat this shit up.",188.82999999999998,556,0,12,2,2,40,0.2661515151515153,-0.19127272727272732,0.07656565656565657,52.698000000000036,-37.87200000000001,15.16,198,176.66684319228938

vi1bhvkDLYKjzouEHhFUFLsG,4,03:34.050,07:05.200,Alex Jekowsky,"So Maru is a group of research whatevers and then basically touch bistro probably contracted Maru to go help them build this thing and they do it annually. So I do think that this project has two roles. I do believe that the benefit of sense of is that we can play a little bit in slice and have a cool website all about laundry, empowering local, that sales enablement, it's great for the multifamily real estate, it's great for one day when we have a fucking billboard in San Francisco, New York, Chicago, LA, et cetera. That just is a QR code and says WDF and people scan it and it's the world of sending out your local laundry, right? Or a powering local. Because eventually we'll want to be a source of branding this industry and branding the concept of laundry, which doesn't exist today. I think it's a really cool opportunity and we can do really funny things like how many laundry bags were spaced to the fucking moon and what are the weird modifiers and what's the craziest thing that somebody's cleaned. That's the slice, that's the slice side. And I think that's a project that we run on National Laundry Day, April 15. And we do a whole campaign about senses crusade to get people to send out their fucking laundry to your local provider and to elevate the brand and experience of what a laundromat or dry cleaner is. Not just that immigrant owner rundown, money laundering piece of shit, but to something that is actually empowering their community. Providing an extremely value added service, but also a luxury amenity of wash and fold and like an actual service that theyre providing. So I kind of see it in two ways, Pablo, where there is the industry trends and report that I think we have to do right, and then plays into how technology is. Gilly, I guess, just sent one from Houzz as well. And there are different ways to provide it. Now we're not going to hire a firm to help us right now to do this. I mean maybe in some ways, maybe to help design. Maybe we work with some cheap contractor, maybe one of our investors has in house, I don't know, that can help us do it. Yeah, to Gilly's point, maybe to help on the design. But it's use these to understand what are the metrics that we think are going to be valuable for the industry. The thing that I think we can take on ourselves, maybe with the help of a cheap upwork designer on Squarespace. Because Laura and I discovered that slice is just a fucking squarespace website, just one template that we can leverage and making a really cool website in that way. I think the two options in the short term right now we do not have, candidly the amount of data that's interesting to me to be able to show some of this stuff. We're just on full service with Laundryworks. Yes, but launchworks data is a fucking mess. It's not easy to get all the insights that we want. We're not 100% there. So I think the first thing that we come out with, and we could come out with something by the end of this year can be something in between. It can be fun and nice, but also tangible, interesting insights with the sole goal of putting it towards operators and it being shared in the Facebook groups and being all of that. Right. But the broader strategy as I think about it, is there's two opportunities and they have completely different audiences. One is whitepaper lead Gen on our website promoted by the CLA. Put your email to capture and view all that kind of stuff. And then the other is really cool on our website and an annual thing we do that laundromat owners can then share with their customers of the trends of laundry.",211.14999999999998,667,0,15,1,1,34,0.2926333333333334,-0.1489749999999999,0.08196666666666672,70.23200000000001,-35.75399999999998,19.67200000000001,240,189.53350698555533

So I just skimmed the Houzz report really quickly and I think that the big buckets in my mind is interesting to read to learn about the industry as if you were like a PE firm looking at industry prospects versus if Im an operator, what are actionable insights? Alex, I dont know if you remember at maybe you werent there, but that guy Oliver, that customer Oliver that were chatting with who was like I would pay $1,500 a year, no problem, for a supercharged CLA report that gave me actual insights on how to grow my business versus just an industry overview and being specific about what data falls in that category. It's like industry overview data is like we saw revenue growth in these metros. Operators don't care if they're operating in Chicago, they don't care how other businesses in Chicago are doing as much as they care about. We saw consumers happy to pay more for downy than, you know, whatever because it's a fabric softener or you know, I'm making this up like something that everyone read would read and be like, wait, I don't offer a fabric softener.

And more importantly, it's data that we have access to. We want to stay within our means here. This is our first time doing this. Doesn't have to be perfect, but I'm asking myself, what would be a good example of tangible data that we could present that is industry wide and interesting, but also actionable? I think it's how we categorize the data. For example, if we had the same kind of data, what percentage of sales are watch orders but broken out regionally? I think thats an interesting thing because someone in Milwaukee is looking at this very differently than someone in California. Another breakout of data would be businesses in this tier. So you break out businesses who are doing over $500,000 in revenue. Then you have businesses that are doing 250 and say, what are these businesses doing? So that someone who's in a $200,000 category, who wants to get to a $500,000 category can say, wow, businesses who are twice as big as me, do they do the same as me?

And then formatting Laura on the design side, like how we want to do it now that you have a bunch of examples of the different things that you want.

I guess the point is that like, that's interesting. Yeah. Here's my perspective, is the only, the value of this kind of meeting on going forward besides just work to execute on some of these things is going to be like at the core of it. What are the fucking questions that we're trying to answer in this sheet, in this thing? What are the insights we're trying to provide? So if somebody wants to make an excel file and say, by the end of this week, add your commentary, add your commentary, add your questions. We have one more meeting of this next week. We whittled down to what we want to see and then we can start to build a report from there. But look, we have some real outliers and data on a percentage of customer and some of these other things that we should just also be mindful of. We dont have to worry about that right now. I think we have this framework. Great. Im glad Ari did it. We should go through and see is this actually valuable? Interesting, et cetera. Theres probably some geographical things that people will want to be interested. Average number of store counts, average time to add another store. A couple of these things. This first one is very important. We know that people want it because slice does do the pizza index thing and to show the average price around, yeah, 100%. So I would just say let's, we can add it to this. It might be easier to add it to a CSV file and just say industry, like hard industry things, fun consumer things, you know, two different sheets. Add self serve related, delivery related. Yeah. And then just like add all the insights that we want to add and then by this time next week.

So that's all about, like, what are the most popular, you know, toppings to sell and how many. How many, you know, pizzas were sold, and there's, like, lifestyle and then money and then travel, and that's more about, like, delivery, specifically relating to, like, how long it took to deliver a pizza or the longest travel distance to deliver a pizza and things like that, and then technology. So I think dividing it up into what are our logical sections that make sense so that also, it's a table of contents. So you could, like, if I was, you know, an operator who doesn't do wash and fold and they only do self serve, and I'm only really interested in that section, I could just click to that section as a table of contents item, and it just takes me right there and I don't have to scroll through everything else that's not relevant to me.

I would eventually, when we have the ability to start talking about. And maybe we'll know more when I close books for the quarter. But I want to start looking at the, not just the sales cycle and efficiency, but also the average value. Average ARPU per customer. Meaning what's our. How many customers do we have? What's the SaaS and what the payments with laundry work stripped out because their payments are really, really high and their SaaS is really, really low. So I want to figure that out. I had a tough conversation with Max earlier just about what I'm seeing from a hardware perspective with sense connect and the penny devices and their reliability issues. I think we're going to be turning a corner soon, hopefully. But obviously I saw that thing in sense competition about fast car charging. Dollar 749 a reader, 4.6% transaction fee, and dollar 30 a month, which then makes me want to go to every single distributor and say, have you seen this? We're half the price. You know, have you seen this? Were such a better deal and such a better value for the operator. Why aren't we winning this deal now? Maybe the distributors like, fuck you. I'm making $300 a reader. That's very possible. Yeah, so that's very possible. But it didn't, it looked like that was a quote directly from CCI is what that thread said. I don't know if that's true. I don't know. I don't know if one of our sales, and I'm assuming one of our sales reps has reached out to that operator. Okay, good. But anyway, I want to start the ARPU concept when I go back to it. And it's a little commercial invoicing because it doesn't happen until net 30 day payments. So commercial invoicing always looks a little bit lower. But let's do take this and then whatever, we'll do all of them. And then I have to filter. Let me just take out the segment. So most of our customers are going to be pos only say, this is like the average, you know, this will, this will increase just from the invoicing. But. And I, you know, again, it's annoying as we don't always know how much at this point. We don't know what data is right and what's not. But if we take August, you know, you have our cost, you have most of our products. You know, the value is pretty good. I don't know what was such a big outlier in June. Right, but you don't have that many customers, right? In this product line, that's our most valuable. We take 7000. See, these records don't have that many. This is pos invoicing. Penny. Excuse me.

So half of our customer base is our lowest ARPu, and the other half. Is going to be something higher. Pos and penny. Pos and invoicing, pos delivery. So that's a net positive, that 50% on the lowest, 50% on the highest. But the blended is then going to be low still. So I just want to get a deeper sense of the net new deals. And, again, we're just not there yet to be able to qualify this. But hopefully soon we're at the point where we can look at our cohorts and say, from when a customer started cohorts, what is the average ARPU, of each quarter that we sold?

I just want us to grow up a little bit. We're building our house on sand right now, and I want to build it on concrete because we have a winner. And I think that's even getting our data organized. There's no one place that we can go see, like, how much hardware software in future payments do we sell this month? And it's ARPU of everything, too. But there's no reflection of laundeworks software anywhere. Anywhere. And that is part of this equation as well. Even I talking about rooftops, that is such a narrow point of view of the business. And I do agree, ARPU, and everything comes into that. But we have to get all that data into one pile so we can look at it like, here's the ARPU that we drove. Because we thought about that a lot. We call it booking ad rate at Easycador. It's like, all the customers we acquire, what do we know about them? What are they trending towards, and what's their future value? So we could say we spent this much money this month, and this is the expected return of that investment from the hor portfolio. But we understood inside each bucket and each method and each everything, how much each customer was valued. And we don't do that. And I agree with that very much.

And it's on finance just to. We got to get finance up to back up to speed of being able to identify these things. But, yeah. And what I'm looking for also more is predictability. We want to know when we sell a customer, what is the chance? What percentage of them are going to look like x in Y amount of time? What percentage are going to add the next location? What percentage are going to add delivery? What percentage are going to buy pennies? What percentage are going to, are they going to perform some action?

So this one that says tufts only. It's basically the same one without the AI piece. So that was sent when? I forgot. I sent it to them like a week ago or something. Tony was, I think I sent it to Tony a week ago. So he has that it. Well, it depends. Like, I've met Jaman's before. Jaman Jackson. Like, he's more. More African American. Yeah. If he's Spanish, then, or Mexican, then his parents really didn't like him. It. Are you sharing? Yeah, I've made the updates, so it's not. I can share it with the whole team here by email. And Bharat, I think you're critical in the story here, because with Will Harvey, he's a hardcore AI guy. He's been doing this for a very long time. And, you know, I think your story will resonate with him. So, you know, I think it'll be important to credentialize ourselves upfront and specifically. No, no. This is all about, you know, why. Why is care gnostics the right partner for early identification initiatives? And you know why? You know why we're the right team to be the long. That long term partner? Right. Like, we can extend into additional use cases. We provide all these different services. Our business model is innovative. You know, we're sponsored by, you know, pharma, allowing us to do this at, you know, pretty much no cost for institutions. I think all these things are going to be important. So, yeah, I mean, I'm happy to go through the deck slide by slide. I don't know if Ganeshka, you want to do a quick dry run here now that we've updated the deck, or, you know, we want to slide. Yeah. Okay. So Scott suggested to take out Soham. Do we want to do that? It. Oh, what happened here? This is the. Sorry, this is not the right one. Yeah, I did. But we're going to make some changes here, and then, you know, I'll send the final after the meeting now. So basically, the slide says, look, we hand hold institution. You don't see it? Can you guys see it? Okay, so the point of this slide is to say, look, we can hand hold you and your institution end to end, from setup of care program to operationalization of the care program. And we have capabilities to support, really along this journey with tufts. Specifically, we're going to help harmonize disparate EHR data sources. We're going to create a model for early identification and intervention specific to lung nodules. We're going to help with the program management pieces of this. So we're going to make sure the project stays on track and provide resources to support with that. We're going to customize solutions for you specific to this use case and more use cases, and then preparing the organization for change. I think that's critical. We've heard that from many institutions where it's not enough to just deploy an AI model, but you need to make sure that clinicians are trained and the care coordinators know how to use this thing and create a mechanism for feedback and ongoing monitoring. So I think we need to definitely stress on those two pieces in the bottom right hand corner. Yes, Brad. No Kanishka has seen this, so go ahead. We took it out. The second box was personalized AI models, or AI model development, and it initially said, build and test personalized AI models for early identification. In this particular scenario, at least on the lung nodule side, we're going to use off the shelf NLP. That's proven tested that can pick up lung nodules. They're out there, they're open sourced. We can. We can. We can use those things. I guess we just need to have a point of view in case he asks. Okay, well, what model are you using? If it is an open source NLP model for lung nodules, you know, are we prepared? I can ask, like, I need to do some investigation, but I. We. Yeah, so I guess the question is, like, if we're identifying lung nodules in radiology reports, is it our proprietary models or is it open source models? If it's open. If it's our proprietary models, then the question might be, okay, well, where have you deployed that model? What's success? What's the sensitivity and specificity of that model? Versus, like, if it's an open source model, the question might be, what model are you using and why are you using that model? So I guess depending on how we answer, you have a perspective. Okay. Yeah. It. Give me an answer by tomorrow, but I'll try. Different. Different. The pac year stuff, Kanishka, that's for lung cancer screening programs where you have very specific criteria of age and pack years to qualify. This is incidental lung nodules. So it's very different. It's looking at past CTS, correct? Yeah. Because he's in the weeds guy and an AI guy and spent his whole career in AI. So, you know, and that, that's, you're going back to the credibility, you know, Bharat and Sri, it's, this is, this is your meeting to be best friends with Doctor Harvey, really? Ultimately, yeah. I think Ganishka leading it is the right move, I think, on this slide, really spending a lot of time talking about your AI experience would be really great. So I think that's sort of the high level of. Approach, and we can help at all phases of setting up care programs. We've done this a few times. Can you share in the Q and A? Take it from here? It. Yeah, PowerPoint just crashed. Um. That's right. That's right. I don't know why I keep thinking tomorrow. You're right. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. Oh, God. The full deck goddess. Sorry, I'm sharing again. But we. Yeah, I mean, I think they are. Doctor K is excited to dive in and had a lot of opinions on what needed to be included in the intelligence summary. So I think that's right. And whatever output we create, they're going to own. And they can use, and they can use for free in perpetuity. So I think that's a value add here. I mean, again, they might ask the question of why is this free? And I think we need to be prepared, again, to answer this. It. Yeah, I mean, typically, basically, what, what ends up happening in the wild is, you know, you have about 25% of incidental lung nodules that are caught at stage one two versus stage three four. And, you know, so it's 25% at stage one two. And 75% at stage three four. With an ILN program, you can flip that paradigm and catch 75% of cancers at stage one two instead of stage three four. That's what, you know, that's common in the literature, and that's what Doctor Zulueta showed with his program as well. Yeah, there's not a lot of real estate on the slide for that, but, yeah, I mean, we can try. So with all the additional workup, you're increasing the value of that patient. So the average patient is about 15% more valuable than they would otherwise have been. Right. Because if you drive them to more CTS downstream, if you drive them to pulmonology visits, you can drive them to oncology, thoracic surgery, surgery, and specifically thoracic surgery is super high value. And tufts really cares about that because they have a strong like that is. That's the entire point. That is why we're doing this program. They want to catch these things. And that's why surgery is sponsoring this, because we're catching things in radiology and then surgery is doing their thoracic surgeries to get these nodules taken out, so. Yep, but that's why she's sponsoring this. That is really the reason why they want more surgery. Volume. The number. I pulled it from one of our previous slides. I need to go back and try to find the source, but there's probably literature out there that shows that incidental lung nodules drive more thoracic surgeries, and maybe that's a data point we want to add in there. It. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. This is an example of.

He actually has a meeting with Bob Garrett and the board of directors later this month, and he will be presenting our slides and Kiaranosti. At that board meeting. So that's number one. We reviewed the slides with him. He's happy, made a couple of changes and he's off to the races. That though we kind of, you know, changed the story. Not change the story, but we created a story out of that. That's the story we're putting into the poster. And we should have the poster done this week. So that that's kind of on track.

I mean, he was right to chastise me for saying we're not clinical. I think. I think where I felt, and it really hit me was when we, and this really hit me yesterday when Barth drew up that three by five thing. I hadn't seen that before. Like, here's the five steps in three and we're on the left versus the right of. When I saw that, it just kind of like, okay, we're trying to do everything for everybody. And that bothered me a lot because it's not clear to me. I think one of the assumptions we're making, and this is the part that got me, was that. We have a solution that would work across any of those things and it doesn't. And so it ends up being. We're going to have to kind of figure out what the solution is. I think you said, right. We haven't even validated that for asthma. The stuff we're doing is actually going to move the needle in GDMT. It should. But there's other things that are missing. And when we dug into COPD, we found, like, okay, wait, there's a whole piece that we probably need to do to drive outcomes. So when Bapa came in, so Bapa chastising us and saying, you idiots, come on, you had this vision. What the hell happened? And he turned to me and said, where's the box? Right? Why aren't you building this box that will do this? That kind of. I actually felt good about getting chastised for that because it tells me that, yeah, we do need to focus on something and we need to anchor on something. And I think, honestly, that's what's been challenging. I like what you did earlier today with me and Scott on chest, where I've been struggling with chess. I don't know where to anchor to. Right. I don't know. There isn't a box to say, this is our starting point and how do we expand this box? And it's kind of all over the place. And maybe I. That's what got me thinking about rather than pushing you and berth, I mean, you guys should come up with the vision for the company. You're absolutely correct. But I also should be contributing. Like, here's what I think a box could look like for us. Here's what I think we can build. Here's a basis for where we can kind of build from. And that's what. That's what I'm missing. That's what we're missing. I think that's the biggest takeaway that I got out of it. I'm also glad that he pushed barth in terms of, dude, what? Where do you see this company? He kind of went on with that. So anyway, that's. That's kind of how I felt. I felt uncomfortable after yesterday's meeting at Wilmington. And then today, I think it kind of crystallized wine. It's okay. We can't be all that. It's a great vision for like five years from now. Okay. I can't think that far ahead. Yeah. That's not a one year vision and we can't present that. But what is our anchor? That's what ultimately, I felt good about it.

And obviously, you're the tech guru of us all in terms of what's that product you and birth? I feel like, yeah, this is the important question. Like what is the kernel from everything? And I think it's intellectually disingenuous to say it's the one page summary because we happened into that. Right. It wasn't, and I don't have anything, I don't have an inherent problem if it wasn't hypothesis driven. But I think it's over simplistic to then say, well, we found it. And it's like, yeah, exactly. And so I caught two things in the call. One is I think Bapa for the first time made me realize how we're doing too much. And it's not that we are trying to do, because at the level that that had always been communicated, I feel like to say like Barth, that's been like, no, I think we're trying to drive GDMT, we're trying to sell health systems, we're trying to build a product, we're trying to, you know, contract with pharma and things like that. And he's right. Those five things we have to be doing. But we have twelve tactics within each of those and that's where it goes wrong. Like just in health system sales, we're trying to sell consulting, trying to work on pulmonology, we're trying to work on transplant, trying to work on this platform sale for Christianity, trying to work on a pediatric sale to these folks. We're trying to work on an independent palm sale. Like, we can't do seven different sales motions. Yes. That's the problem. It's not how many. Right. We should have five companies in the funnel. We can have five companies with five different sales motions. Yes. And if we go to a new health system, it can't be. Well, yeah, we'll figure out whatever you want. It's got to be like scope down to, yeah, I'm selling these four things today and I can sell them today if you want something else. Yeah. My capabilities are. That's, that's part of my roadmap.

We shouldn't end up in the situation where, because someone says they're interested, we do it. We should evaluate it and say, does it make the list now? Yes. We're not doing it now. Doesn't mean we don't do it. And I think the one area of the buckets that we're really not doing enough of in is capability development. I actually really like our vision of the platform. I like the three by five as a five year vision, as why we started care gnostics. And I think that's all barth means it as. And I think we got to make sure Bapa knows that. Hey, no one's saying we can sell that today. But where I have an issue is, we've got this data layer of. We pull in your EHR data better, but there's ways to expand that capability with hies, with SDOH, with other data. That should be an effort someone's working on or thinking about or in our roadmap, at least. Then there's the AI layer of developing the insights. All right? Someone's got to have capabilities in that or not, or we're not doing it. Then there's. I think there's actually two. I think there's the clinical decision support like recommendation layer. Right now, that's just guideline mapping, which is great. We can do that. But at some point, we might want Genai in there of how do we make that intelligible and interpretable and whatnot. And then finally, there's the delivery to the different folks, and we've got one for specialists. We've got one for pop health. But I imagine in all four of these levels, adding additional capabilities will allow us to tackle more problems. Yeah. And I don't know if that's the way to approach it, but that way ehr app is there or something like that. And then it's like, we'll go and we'll solve heart failure, because we say it lines up as what we want to solve now or transplant. And in solving transplant, we will add capabilities at each of those layers. We should also strategically add capabilities that we know make everything stronger, like the HiE or the SDOH or where we think we need to differentiate or invest in really sprucing up our interfaces. Right. And, like, get someone in there on, like, how do we make these way sexier or whatnot?

But from the angle of what is it that we need to build? And you're right. If we can come up with this is what we want to be able to do initially, then it becomes. It's hard, but it becomes straightforward to say, these are the capabilities that really can help us sex up this thing and make it real. And I can and I know where to invest it. Right. Because you're right. One thing might be sdoh ingestion. That's a huge thing. Another thing might be Genai. Another thing might be there's all kinds of ways that we can deliver back stuff. Yeah.

It's not that I don't like it. I think it's great. Five year vision. The problem is, when you present that to someone like Christiana, they don't see it as a five. That's the thing. They don't see it as a five year vision. Right. And it's like we're all over the place. That's something I would not share, except to the most strategic of people externally.

I was just talking to one of my old sales guys at within health and kind of going through, like, what are, you know, what are the biggest things, in his opinion? And he thinks that, like, and I do agree with that. I mean, he thinks that having brand recognition and having a brand, that customers have faith that you can do what you're promising. I think that is the biggest hurdle to jump right from, like, little startup, that's like doing something to, like, establish, hey, we're doing things. People recognize who we are in a very specific niche market. Obviously, everyone's talking about us. People are, you know, I think you haven't crossed that chasm yet. And that's because we've been so, we've been so shotgunny in our approach. We haven't really built community, we haven't built brand recognition and trust with physicians to be able to sell meaningfully and quickly. So, for what it's worth, the other thing he said is free is a no no. I mean, we've heard it multiple times over and over again, but it's just not a good look. Um, it's better to say, you know, we're five k a year than to say that you're. You're free, right? Like, you're whatever, whatever it is. But, like, the financials are never an issue. In his opinion. Yeah, the other thing is, like, we haven't been doing well and that we, you know, he says that. And so I think we're starting to do that. Like what we did with the guy last week, doctor what's his name, last Friday that we spoke to doctor sine, like, really understanding the process. Like we're going to these people and saying, hey, we have this thing, but then that's it, we're done. That's not how you can get anywhere. Like, you really need to build a cross functional champ. Like, you need to have champions in every organization, like clinical it and leadership. If you don't have those three champions and a clear and clear visibility on what the process is, steps are for each organization, you're going to fail every single time. So that was sort of his perspective on, like, what are some of the things we can do to unlock? And I sort of, I agree. I mean, we've been hearing the same things over and over again.

We're very focused on asthma, but like, what are we building in asthma? I think we need to be smarter about what we're building and what the value prop for an asthma solution is for different stakeholders, different segments, all that stuff. Right. And then, like, really building a community with some of these asthma physicians, really having doctor fine go out and talk about this and that, like, building credibility, getting some data and like, you know, all that stuff. Like, all that is important, but we need, we need to focus. We need to be hyper focused and, yeah, I think, I think that's the, that's the only answer. And I, I don't know if asthma is the right wedge into the health system, honestly, like, it doesn't sound like it's a massive priority for these people. But again, I don't know, I don't think we've spoken to enough of them and we haven't spoken to, we don't have representation across the different segments we spoke about. So I think ideally, you want to be in a better position to sell. You need to build relationships with all these physicians that are doing asthma related work. You need to have a legitimate paper that says you're improving outcomes meaningfully, you're reducing readmissions, you're saving time. You need to have doctor fine and a community of leaders that are talking about you, that are building critical. Credibility. We need to be extremely active on. On social media, publishing our results, you know, announcing new health systems, new health system partnerships. Like, all those things build credibility in the Kia Gnostics brand. But again, like, you can't do this if you're like, super shotgun y, right? Because the communities of practice within a health system are so broad. You need to be super focused and super, super, super. Yeah. So that's. That's why, in my opinion, that's why we're not selling. We haven't been focused. We're. We're too shotgunny. We don't have a strong. We don't have strong conviction that asthma is even the right place. You know, there's. There's definitely some legacy and tech debt.

Kanishka, we've moved the pointer so many times over the last six months, and so I don't think we've spent enough time doing. I think the only two things that we did a proper, like, experiment, we ran a proper experiment on was lung cancer and transplant. I think that was done excellently well. Like, going through the motions, doing discovery, understanding whether it's a paint moist, trying to convert those discovery conversations into an actual sale, which, you know, we then realize that we have challenges doing that on the lung cancer side, and maybe it's not a space worth doing. Kill it. Go to the next space. Right? Like, we didn't go to the next space after we did transplant.
